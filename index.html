<p>Search and rescue volunteers face a shortcoming in technology
					that is available for their needs. Increasing the number of systems
					designed for search and rescue helps to improve the capabilities of
					volunteers and helps more people to be found alive and well. It is
					easy to use allowing anyone to use the syste. The core of this
					project was creating a field transmitter prototype, and programming
					it to adapt to how it is being used in order to save as much energy
					as possible and eliminate the need for volunteers pause the search
					and recharge the device. Search and rescue assistant is a system
					comprising of 3 parts, a mapping program, a home base receiver, and
					a field transmitter. A typical search and rescuer operation
					consists of 3-5 man teams that report to a commander who
					coordinates efforts. For this system, every team would be given a
					field transmitter and would perform a &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; where
					the device gets the teams GPS position. That information would be
					sent to the receiver which translates the information for the
					computer program. The program automatically updates the commanders
					topographic map with where teams are and displays areas that have
					been searched.</p>
